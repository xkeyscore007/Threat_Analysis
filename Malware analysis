Skills learned - CREATING AND ANALYSING YARA RULES AND IOCs 

Tools used - Mandiant(Acquired by FireEye) IOC and Redline

Objective - Creating an IOC and YARA rules to scan the network for this malware(sitting as a .pdf file ).
   • Create a IOC for malware
      ◇ Using MD5, size of file and few strings in the IOC
   • Testing IOC with Mandiant redline
      ◇ Importing malware in redline and checking if it detects malware in particular locations in Desktop
      ◇ Create IOC search
      ◇ Run RunLine Audit.bat
         ▪ It  creates a session and shows potential malware hit
   • Creating a basic YARA rule for the malware using different Strings from IOC and its hash(WinMD5)
      ◇ Open eoyfr.yar file and different strings found using STRINGS in malware file
   • Testing YARA rule with YARA and reviewing with YARGEN.PY to to check for other interesting strings 
      ◇ We got miss from YARA rule running, so crooss check strings using yargen_rules.yar and update eoyfr.py

Drawbacks - False positives
