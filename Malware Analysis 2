Skills learned - 

  * HUNTING INSIDER THREATS i.e spotting abnormal patterns based on speciefic protocols 
  * Network miner gives good overview and for detial, go to wireshark
  * ARP poisioning 
  * DHCP conflict

Tools used
  * Network miner(all-in-one) and Wireshark

Objective
  * Using HYPOTHESIS-BASED hunting to hunt insider threat activity reading PCAP files and identifying malicious behaviour
  
Steps
      ◇ Loading and analyzing 3 PCAPs with over 100k + packets
      ◇ Hosts tab shows potential vulnerable hosts 
         ▪ New unrecognized device is present in network
      ◇ Check Sessions tab 
      ◇ Identify abnormal TCP behavior packets 
      ◇ Unknown protocol used - BJNP
         ▪ By canon to scan network for Canon printers
         ▪ Malicious host interacting with two other hosts, evidence of ARP poisioning, hints MITM in the network
           Snooping over creds
         ▪ Logs in to server using captured creds and transfers ntds.dit via mounted share 

Result
  * Found 3 rogue hosts in the network, performing MITM to snoop over admin creds
