Skills learned 
   * CREATING AND ANALYSING YARA RULES AND IOCs 

Tools used
   * Mandiant IOCe (now acquired by FireEye)and Redline

Objective
   * Creating an IOC and YARA rules to scan the network for this malware(present in network as a .pdf file ).
   
Steps
   • Create an IOC for malware
      ◇ Use MD5, size of file and few relevant strings in the IOC
   • Testing IOC with Mandiant redline
      ◇ Importing malware in redline and checking if it detects malware in particular locations in Desktop
      ◇ Create an IOC search
      ◇ Run RunLine Audit.bat
         ▪ It  creates a session and shows potential malware hit
   • Creating a basic YARA rule for the malware using different Strings from IOC and its hash(WinMD5)
      ◇ Open eoyfr.yar file and append different strings found using STRINGS on malware file
   • Testing YARA rule with YARA and reviewing with YARGEN.PY to to check for other interesting strings 
      ◇ We got miss from YARA rule running, so cross check strings using yargen_rules.yar and update eoyfr.py

Drawbacks
   * False positives
